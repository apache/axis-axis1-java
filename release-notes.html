<h2>Axis 1.1 Release Notes</h2>

<p>This is the <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis/releases.html">1.1 release</a> 
  of the <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis"> Axis SOAP library</a>.</p>

<h3>About this release</h3>
<p>This release is primarily an upgrade to fix a number of bugs in the 1.0 release. 
  Since it took longer than we expected, you'll also find a bunch of new features 
  in there.</p>
<p>We still have a *lot* of <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/">open 
  bugs</a> on the books, so please realize that this is not a completely polished 
  work yet. After 1.1 ships we hope / plan to do a lot of work cleaning things 
  up and adding some much-needed functionality which is currently missing, in 
  hopes of releasing a much better 1.2 release in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>We say this a lot, but it's worth repeating - you can help! If you've got coding 
  skill, interest, and a little free time, we'd love to have you join the Axis 
  community and help make the product better - see below.</p>

  and <a href="http://java.sun.com/xml/saaj/">SAAJ</a> specifications from Sun. 
  The Axis code has successfully passed the all of the JAX-RPC and SAAJ TCK (Technology 
  Compatibility Kit) tests.</p>

<h3>How You Can Help</h3>

  appreciated. We particularly encourage you to submit improvements to the documentation, 
  however large or small and in any format, to axis-dev@ws.apache.org. Also, 
  interoperability is always a concern, so please report all <i>replicable</i> 
  bugs.</p>
